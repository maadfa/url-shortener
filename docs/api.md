# API Guide (How it works)

This app has two main functions:

1. Make a short URL from a long one
2. Open the short URL and go to the original long one

---

## 1. POST /shorten

**What it does:**  
This lets you turn a long website link (URL) into a short one.

**How to use it:**
- You send a POST request to `/shorten`
- You must include your long URL like this:

```json
{
  "longUrl": "https://example.com"
}
```

2.  GET /shortCode


When someone opens the short link (for example: https://yourdomain.com/abc123), it will automatically open the original long link.

Users donâ€™t have to send anything. Just click or type the short link in your browser and it will take you to the full website.


**What you get back**:

A new short link, like 

```json
{
  "shortUrl": "https://yourdomain.com/abc123"
}
```
