AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service from Amazon.

API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy to create, publish, maintain, and monitor APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).</p> <p>What it does in this project:    API Gateway acts as the entry point to the application.</p> <p>It receives HTTP requests POST to shorten URLs and GET to get them and passes them to the correct Lambda function.</p> <p>Why it's useful: </p> <p>Security &amp; control: You can manage who accesses your APIs.</p> <p>Scalable: Automatically handles many incoming requests at once.</p> <p>Flexible routing: You can map different routes like <code>/shorten</code> or <code>/{shortCode}</code> to different Lambda functions.</p>"},{"location":"technologies/#amazon-dynamodb","title":"Amazon DynamoDB","text":"<p>What is it? </p> <p>DynamoDB is Amazon\u2019s fast and flexible NoSQL database service and is designed for high-performance applications.</p> <p>What it does in this project:  Stores the mapping between short codes and long URLs.</p> <p>When someone enters a short code, the app looks it up in DynamoDB to find the matching original URL.</p> <p>Why it's useful: </p> <p>High performance: Quickly reads/writes data even massive amount of data and leads to high performance.</p> <p>Serverless: With serverless architecture,there is no need to manage database servers.This saves time and money.</p> <p>Highly available: Your data is always accessible.</p>"},{"location":"technologies/#serverless-framework","title":"Serverless Framework","text":"<p>What is it? </p> <p>The Serverless Framework is an open-source tool that helps you build and deploy serverless applications easily using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).</p> <p>What it does in this project: </p> <p>It manages the deployment of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB  by use of  one simple configuration file (<code>serverless.yml</code>).</p> <p>It automates the creation of AWS resources with a single command (<code>sls deploy</code>).</p> <p>Why it's useful: </p> <p>Simple deployments: Deploy everything with one command.</p> <p>Reusable code: Write configuration once and use it across environments.</p> <p>Faster development: Focus on your application, not the infrastructure.</p>"},{"location":"technologies/#http-methods-get-post","title":"HTTP Methods: GET &amp; POST","text":"<p>What are they? </p> <p>They are types of requests sent from a client (like your browser or an app) to the server.</p> <p>POST: Post request is used when you send data to the app (e.g., a long URL to be shortened).</p> <p>GET: Get request is used when you request data (e.g., getting a short URL ).</p> <p>Why they're important: </p> <p>These methods are how users interact with your API.
